# Flutter JSON Deep Search Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

As contributors and maintainers of this open-source Flutter library, we are committed to fostering an inclusive and welcoming environment. We pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Community Standards

To create a positive environment, we encourage:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences
* Accepting constructive criticism gracefully
* Prioritizing the community's best interests
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Unacceptable behaviors include:

* Sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
* Other conduct deemed inappropriate in a professional setting

## Maintainers' Role

Project maintainers are responsible for defining acceptable behavior and are expected to take fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior. They have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful behavior.

## Scope of Application

This Code of Conduct applies within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Representation includes using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Project maintainers may further define and clarify representation.

## Reporting and Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported by contacting the project team at report@wanmind.com.br. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated, resulting in a response deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
